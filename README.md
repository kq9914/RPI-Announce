# RPI-Announce
This is a hastily written script to create an announcement queue for the Raspberry Pi.  The specific purpose was to use in conjunction with OpenHab to queue announcements to make throughout the house.
 
 
 **WARNING: this is not even close to being secure.  The script runs as root and is almost guaranteed to be vulnerable to command injection**
